#
# Purpose: read supplementary table S3 from .csv into a dataframe

# TASK - read Table_S3.csv
# ================================================

# I have included a dataset with this project, a .csv file taken from
# suplementary data of a paper on tissue definition by single cell RNA seq, by
# Jaitin et al. (2014).

# http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531970

# This data set contains log values of expression changes in different cell
# types, responding to lipopolysaccharide stimulation. It was posted as an Excel
# file.  I have simply opened that file, and saved it as .csv, unchanged.

# First we open the file and have a look what it contains. Then we will properly
# read it into an R object.

rawDat <- read.csv("table_S3.csv",
header = FALSE,
stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# The object "rawDat" should appear in the Data section of the Environment tab
# in the top-right pane. It has a spreadsheet symbol next to it. Click that - or
# type View(rawDat), and study the object. You should find:
# - all columns are named Vsomething
# - rows 1 to 6 do not contain data
# - there is not a single row that could be used for column names
# - type str(rawDat): all columns are characters.

# This all needs to be fixed.


LPSdat <- rawDat[-(1:6), ]  # drop first six rows
colnames(LPSdat) <- c("genes",      # gene names
"B.ctrl",     # Cell types are taken from
"B.LPS",      # Figure 4 of Jaitin et al.
"MF.ctrl",    # .ctrl and .LPS refer to control
"MF.LPS",     #   and LPS challenge
"NK.ctrl",    # The cell types are:
"NK.LPS",     #   B:    B-cell
"Mo.ctrl",    #   MF:   Macrophage
"Mo.LPS",     #   NK:   Natural killer cell
"pDC.ctrl",   #   Mo:   Monocyte
"pDC.LPS",    #   pDC:  plasmacytoid dendritic cell
"DC1.ctrl",   #   DC1:  dendritic cell subtype 1
"DC1.LPS",    #   DC2:  dendritic cell subtype 2
"DC2.ctrl",   #
"DC2.LPS",    #
"cluster")    # Gene assigned to cluster by authors
rownames(LPSdat) <- 1:nrow(LPSdat)

for (i in 2:ncol(LPSdat)) { # convert number columns to numeric
LPSdat[,i] <- as.numeric(LPSdat[ ,i])
}

# Done - we can remove "rawDat"
rm(rawDat)

# confirm
# head(LPSdat)
# str(LPSdat)

# typeInfo(LPSdat)


# [END]
